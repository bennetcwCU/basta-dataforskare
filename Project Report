The focus of this project is the brainstorm a way to increase bike ridership in Dc.

Our group decided to look at the methods of transportation that commuters were taking.
The main objective was to compare the metro ridership in the different neighborhood codes to the
bike ridership in the corresponding codes. 

The first assumption our group had to make was what month we would be taking data from.
September seems reasonable because people would be back to school and work.
Additionally, there are no major holidays and the weather is still decent for people to be riding bikes.
Tourism in September is not as high as it is during summer, and life is relativly normal.

The first step in the project was finding data that would be useful to the question.
The data sets we found useful were: 
  -Metro_stattion_entrances: this data shows where all the entrances to the metro station are
  -Metro_stations_regional: this set gives the count and times of people riding the metro
  -202309_capitalbikeshar-tripdata: this set is the data on bike ridership
  -DC_health_planning_neighborhoods: gives the neighbothoods of DC

Once all data sets are loaded into R, we were tasking with cleaning the data to the variables desired.
We knew we wanted the locations, number of people, time of day, and form of transportation of the commuters.
So to keep all this data, packages such as plyr, tidyverse, janitor, lubrudate, and dplyr were used.
Functions such as mutate and filter were the most useful when cleaning our data.
Assuptions for commuters were made that we would only keep data from weekdays.

After the data was filtered to the desired size, we were tasked to join the data sets to compare.

Finally, a visual was created to compare bike riders and metro riders. 
We then drew the conclusion that bike ridership can be increased if there were more stations
located in areas where there little to no metro stations, but a good amount of people taking the metro.
This is due to the fact that there is a "last mile" effect occuring. Many people will take the metro 
to as close to their place of work as possible, but then they will need to walk from the metro
to their work. By adding more bike stations in these areas, commuters will be able to finish
their commute via bike instead of by foot.
